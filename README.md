# Work Item Bulk Mover Plugin for RTC
While RTC supports to move a single Work Item from one project area to another, it lacks the capability of doing so for a bunch of Work Items at once. 

## Motivation
There are a couple of quite common use cases where moving a whole bunch of Work Items is necessary:
 - **Splitting or merging projects**: Project structure changes often need to be reflected in RTC, e.g. by moving a part of a project area to a new one.
 - **Moving to another process template**: There are differente approaches to move to a new process template. One of it is to create an entirely new project area from scratch. Easily transferring the existing work items to the new area is a key requirement.
